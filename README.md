# **Employee Management System**

## **Overview**
The **Employee Management System** is an interactive Python-based application designed to streamline the management of employee data. The project leverages Python's capabilities, with a focus on organizing, retrieving, and updating employee records in an efficient and user-friendly way. This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) implementation for ease of visualization and interactivity.

## **Features**
- Add new employee records.
- Update existing employee details.
- Delete employee records.
- View a list of all employees.
- Search and filter employees by specific criteria.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language for the implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and presentation.
- **Libraries**: Includes commonly used Python libraries ('cv').
